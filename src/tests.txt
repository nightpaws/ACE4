Testing:

1. After setting up the proxy in the browser of your choice the local webserver can be tested by
 navigating to: localhost/bubbles.gif - Image should load as expected, view locally to compare.
 
2. Testing web access: accessing bbc.co.uk should render the page correctly with images.

3. Testing cache: By editing the file "bbc.co.uk" in the project source directory to alter
  text displayed to your own preference should be displayed in browser if the page is reloaded.
  It may be necessary to press cmd+shift+R or ctrl+shift+F5 to clear the browsers local cache
   to ensure the caching of the web server is functional.
